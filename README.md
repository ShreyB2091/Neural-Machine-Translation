# Machine-Translation-model
Aims to study and implement Seq2Seq LSTM models for machine translation.  
The documentation of this project will be updated here shortly.

## Project Timeline
### Week 1:
- Literature Review  Reading articles and going through papers and tutorials about the implementation of Seq2Seq LSTM models.
### Week 2: Dataset and Model implementation  
- Looked for the dataset of appropriate size, to provide enough variety, for the training of the model.
- And implemented and trained the model on the data.
