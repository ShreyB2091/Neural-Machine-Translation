# Machine-Translation-model
Aims to study and implement Seq2Seq LSTM models for machine translation.  
The documentation of this project will be updated here shortly.

## Project Timeline
### Week 1: Literature Review
- Read articles and go through papers and tutorials about the implementation of LSTM Seq2Seq models for neural machine translation.

### Week 2: Dataset and Model implementation  
- Look for the dataset of appropriate size, to provide enough variety, for the training of the model.
- Implement and train the model on the data set.


### Week 3: Testing
- Test and improve the model to reach maximum efficiency.
